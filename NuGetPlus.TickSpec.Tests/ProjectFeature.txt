Feature: Project level operations should work

Scenario outline: Installing should work
	Given a <project type> with <existing packages>
	When I install Nuget.Core
	Then the package should be installed in the right directory
	And the reference should be added to the project file
	And the package should be added to the packages.config file

	Examples:
	| project type	| existing packages	|
	| FsProj		| packages			|
	| FsProj		| no packages		|
	| CsProj		| packages			|
	| CsProj		| no packages		|
